# Reporting An Issue

When creating an issue, please provide:
* What version of Compile Pal you are running
* What game you are compiling for
* Upload debug.log (found in the Compile Pal folder)
* If a your issue is a crash, a crash log from the CrashLog folder

If your issue is related to packing it can be helpful to provide a copy of the asset that is failing to pack. 
If you are not comfortable with uploading your assets to a public place such as GitHub, thats perfectly fine.
